# wrd-myotest-library-feeder
Interface to the Myotest Step Analysis library on the Wearable Reference Design (WRD)

This module performs the following tasks:

- Initialize the Myotest Step Analysis library
- Read the raw, 3 axes, accelerometer sensor signal (from either the WRD accelerometer or pre-recorded data sets)
- If needed, convert the acceleration signal to the required format (time stamp in millisecond and acceleration in milliG)
- Feed the 3 axes accelerometer signal to the Myotest Step Analysis library
